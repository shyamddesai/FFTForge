# **FFTForge**

## **Project Overview**
FFTForge is a Python-based framework designed for in-depth exploration and application of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques. 
It features custom implementations of FFT and Inverse FFT alongside comparisons with NumPyâ€™s FFT. 
The project emphasizes signal processing concepts, image compression, and noise reduction with detailed visualizations.

## **Key Objectives and Features**
1. **Custom FFT Implementation and Validation**:
   - Developed a Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm for both 1D and 2D transformations.
   - Implemented a corresponding Inverse FFT for accurate image reconstruction.
   - Benchmarked the custom FFT results against NumPy's optimized `fft2` and `ifft2` to ensure correctness.
2. **Noise Reduction and Filtering**:
   - Applied low-pass filtering in the frequency domain to effectively remove high-frequency noise while preserving essential image details.
   - Enabled configurable keep ratios to control the filtering intensity.
3. **Image Compression**:
   - Achieved data reduction by enforcing sparsity in the FFT magnitudes.
   - Analyzed trade-offs between compression levels and image quality through visual demonstrations.
4. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Generated detailed log-scaled magnitude plots for original, transformed, and reconstructed images.
   - Enhanced visualizations with customizable color bars and annotations highlighting denoising and compression effects.

## **Usage**
To execute the main program, use the following command:
 ```
 python fft.py [-m mode] [-i image]
 ```

### Arguments
   - `mode` (optional): Specify the mode of operation. Defaults to [1] Fast mode.
      - [1] Fast Mode: Converts the image to its FFT representation and displays the log-scaled magnitude.
      - [2] Denoise: Applies FFT, truncates high frequencies, and reconstructs the denoised image.
      - [3] Compress: Performs image compression in the frequency domain and visualizes results at various levels.
      - [4] Runtime Analysis: Plots runtime graphs comparing computational complexities of Naive DFT and FFT implementations.

- `image` (optional): Provide the filename of the image to process. Defaults to moonlanding.png.

## **Example Execution**
### **Display FFT Magnitude**
Run the program in the default fast mode with the default image:
```
python fft.py
```
Output: Displays the original image alongside its log-scaled FFT magnitude.

### **Denoising with FFT**
Apply a low-pass filter to denoise the image, retaining various percentages of the frequency domain ranging from 1% to 90%:
```
python fft.py --mode 2 --image moonlanding.png 
```
Output Examples:
- At 8% Keep Ratio: Displays the original and denoised image at a keep ratio of 8%. 
![FFT-Denoise-8%](results/mode_2/denoising_results_0.08.png)

- At 20% Keep Ratio: Displays the original and denoised image at a keep ratio of 20%. 
![FFT-Denoise-20%](results/mode_2/denoising_results_0.20.png)

- At 50% Keep Ratio: Displays the original and denoised image at a keep ratio of 50%.

### **Compression**
Compress the FFT magnitude to retain only a certain percentage of non-zero values:
```
python fft.py --mode 3 --image moonlanding.png
```
Output: Displays the original and compressed images at various compression levels, along with matrix sizes.

### **Runtime Analysis**
Analyze and compare the runtime performance of the Naive DFT and FFT algorithms:
```
python fft.py --mode 4
```
Output: Plots the runtime comparison graph between Naive DFT and FFT.
